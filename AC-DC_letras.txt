Back In Black
(A. Young / M. Young / B. Johnson)

back in black I hit the sack
I been too long, I'm glad to be back
yes I am
let loose from the noose
that's kept me hanging about
I keep looking at the sky cause it's gettin' me high
forget the hearse cause I'll never die
I got nine lives cat's eyes
using every one of them and runnin' wild
cause I'm back
yes I'm back well I'm back
yes I'm back
well I'm back back
well I'm back in black
yes I'm back in black
back in the back of a Cadillac
number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
yes I am
in a bang with the gang
they gotta catch me if they want me to hang
cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
nobody's gonna get me on another rap
so look at me now I'm just makin' my play
don't try to push your luck just get out of my way
cause I'm back
yes I'm back
well I'm back
yes I'm back
well I'm back back
well I'm back in black
yes I'm back in black

well I'm back yes I'm back
well I'm back yes I'm back
well I'm back back
well I'm back in black
yes I'm back in black

well I'm back back
well I'm back back
back back
back in black
yes I'm back in black

outta sight
